## My process

### Built with

- SolidJS
- Skypack
- CSS

### What I learned

- Solid is React-like and I wanted to check it out.  
- className doesn't work with skypack implementation?
- CSS design problems => shrink font-size.

### Continued development

- Need more padding on bottom card to make exact.  But then font-sizes have to shrink.
